## Outline

### Remotes - Pushing & Pulling

At this point, students should pause, and instructor will diagram the concept
of git remotes (GH)

#### We Do

* Create a new GH repo, 'rainy_day'
  * Don't initialize it with a readme!
* Follow the instructions to link this repo to your local repo
* Use “git status” to see the status of the repo
* Use “git remote -v" to see list remotes
* Make a change to your haiku, and use add / commit them locally
  * Did it change on GitHub?
* Use "git push" to push changes to GitHub
* Add your partner as a collaborator to the repo.
* That partner should clone the repo using 'git clone'
* That partner should add a haiku to the file, then git add, commit, and push.
* The original creator should 'git pull'
* Flip roles and repeat.
